# A brief description of the exercise

THL has ordered us to create a vaccination database which contains information about vaccine orders and vaccinations.
We have received files which contains the base data for the application.
The Orders are in different files named by the manufacturer of a vaccine.
Injections must be used in 30 days after the arrival of the bottle.
Make a web application for presenting some interesting data about the vaccinations.
